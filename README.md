# algorithms_in_dart

Implementation of some most uses algorithms and data structures in dart.

## List of the implemented algorithms and data structures: ##

- Euclidean algorithm for finding GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
- Selection sort and quick sort algorithms
- Binary search algorithm
- Recursive algorithms
- Hash table data structure
- Graph data structure (both using `Node class` and `Map` for showing graphs)
- Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm
- Binary search tree
- Dijkstra algorithm
- Greedy algorithm for solving set covering problem
- Dynamic programming for finding longest substring between two given string and also
  solving `knapsack problem`
